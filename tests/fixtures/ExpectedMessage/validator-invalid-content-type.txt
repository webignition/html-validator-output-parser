        Sorry, I am unable to validate this document because its content type
        is <code>application/x-javascript</code>, which is
        not currently supported by this service.

        The Content-Type header is sent by your web server (or web browser if
        you use the file upload interface) and depends on its configuration.
        Commonly, web servers will have a mapping of filename extensions
        (such as ".html") to <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>
        <code>Content-Type</code> values (such as <code>text/html</code>).
      </p><p>
        That you received this message can mean that your server is
        not configured correctly, that your file does not have the correct
        filename extension, or that you are attempting to validate a file
        type that we do not support yet. In the latter case you should let
        us know that you need us to support that content type (please include
        all relevant details, including the URL to the standards document
        defining the content type) using the instructions on the
        <a href="feedback.html">Feedback Page</a>.
