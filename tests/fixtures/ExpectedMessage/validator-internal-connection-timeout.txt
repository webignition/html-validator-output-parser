    I got the following unexpected response when trying to
    retrieve &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p><code>500 Can't connect to example.com:80 (connect: Connection timed out)</code></p>
  </blockquote><p>
    If you made recent changes to your domain name (DNS) configuration, you may
    also want to <a href="http://www.squish.net/dnscheck/">check that your
    domain records are correct</a>, or ask your hosting company to do so.
